## [0.5.1] - 2025-12-22

### Fixed
- CRITICAL: HKDF salt randomization bug (made all seals undecryptable)

- DB-backed rate limiting (persistent across workers)
- DB-backed nonce storage (replay protection)
- Browser fingerprinting for rate limits (IP + UA + Lang)
- Timing attack mitigation (random jitter 0-100ms)

### Fixed
- CRITICAL: Pulse interval bug (1000x multiplier removed)
- Serverless state vulnerabilities (moved to D1 database)
- Rate limit bypass via IP rotation (fingerprinting added)
- Replay attacks across worker instances (DB nonces)

### Security
- Rate limits now persist in D1 database
- Nonces stored in D1 for distributed replay protection
- Timing attacks prevented with response jitter
- Decryption integrity validation added
- Cryptographic receipts for tamper detection

### Database
- Added `blob_hash` column for content verification
- Added `unlock_message` column for custom messages
- Added `expires_at` column for auto-expiration
- Added `access_count` column for statistics
- Added `rate_limits` table for persistent rate limiting
- Added `nonces` table for replay protection

## [0.4.0] - 2025-12-22

### Added
- HTTP method validation on all endpoints
- Request origin validation
- Concurrent request limiting (5 per IP)
- Suspicious pattern detection (sequential seal IDs)
- Seal age validation (2 year maximum)

### Security
- Method-based access control (GET/POST only)
- Origin header validation
- Concurrent request tracking and limiting
- Sequential access pattern detection
- Enhanced logging for suspicious activity

- ✅ E2E test fixtures and mocking
- ✅ Metrics and health check endpoints

### Fixed

- Tailwind border color definition added

- Seal ID enumeration possible without obfuscation
- R2 Object Lock integration incomplete
- Playwright E2E tests need debugging
