# Security Policy

## Threat Model

Time-Seal is designed to protect against:
- ✅ Server compromise (split-key architecture)
- ✅ Early access attempts (R2 Object Lock + time validation)
- ✅ Admin deletion (WORM compliance)
- ✅ Man-in-the-middle (HTTPS + client-side crypto)
- ✅ Client-side time manipulation (server-side validation)

## Time-Lock Security

### How Time Validation Works

1. **Server-Side Time Check**: All unlock time validation happens on Cloudflare Workers using `Date.now()`
2. **Key B Withholding**: Server refuses to release Key B until `serverTime >= unlockTime`
3. **Trusted Time Source**: Cloudflare Workers use NTP-synchronized clocks across their global network

### Attack Scenarios & Defenses

#### ❌ Client Changes System Clock
**Attack**: User sets their device clock forward to bypass countdown
**Defense**: Time check happens server-side; client clock is irrelevant

#### ❌ Attacker Compromises Server Clock
**Attack**: Gain root access to server and change system time
**Defense**: 
- Cloudflare Workers run in isolated V8 contexts
- No root access to underlying infrastructure
- Time synchronized via Cloudflare's NTP infrastructure

#### ❌ Time Skew Attack
**Attack**: Exploit clock drift between client and server
**Defense**: Only server time matters; client countdown is cosmetic

#### ⚠️ Cloudflare Infrastructure Compromise
**Risk**: If Cloudflare's entire infrastructure is compromised, time could theoretically be manipulated
**Mitigation**: This is outside our threat model (requires nation-state level attack)

### Time Validation Code

```typescript
// lib/sealService.ts (line 103-110)
const now = Date.now(); // Server time, not client time
const isUnlocked = now >= seal.unlockTime;

let decryptedKeyB: string | undefined;
if (isUnlocked) {
  decryptedKeyB = await decryptKeyBWithFallback(seal.keyB, sealId, [this.masterKey]);
  metrics.incrementSealUnlocked();
}
```

The server **never trusts client-provided time** and always uses its own clock.

## Known Limitations

### 🟡 Medium
1. **No Authentication** - Anyone with seal ID can check status (by design for public vaults)
2. **Key A in URL Hash** - Visible in browser history, bookmarks, and referrer logs
3. **Pulse Token Replay** - Nonce validation prevents replays but tokens are long-lived

### 🟢 Low / Accepted Trade-offs
4. **Seal ID Enumeration** - Cryptographically random IDs (16 bytes) make guessing impractical
5. **Public Vault Access** - Anyone can view countdown timer (content remains encrypted)

## Mitigations

### ✅ Implemented
- **Rate Limiting** - 10-20 req/min per IP across all API endpoints
- **Cryptographically Random Seal IDs** - 16-byte random IDs (not sequential)
- **Turnstile CAPTCHA** - On seal creation to prevent automation
- **Nonce Validation** - Pulse tokens include nonces to prevent replay attacks
- **Client-side Encryption** - Key A never sent to server
- **Split-Key Architecture** - No single point of failure
- **HTTPS-only** - Enforced by Cloudflare
- **Input Validation** - File size limits, time constraints
- **Audit Logging** - Immutable access trail

### 🔧 Optional Enhancements
```typescript
// Additional Cloudflare WAF rules
// IP reputation filtering
// Geographic restrictions
// Advanced bot detection
```
